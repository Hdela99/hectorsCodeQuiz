Hello. My name is Hector De La Cruz and this little project is my Code Refresher quiz. While it may be small for now it will eventually grow as my knowledge grows. It will have very niche and specific questions that I can always use to assure that though there may be somethings I have not touched on in a while I will still retain some general knowledge of the language. It is a simple quiz that uses the time left when the quiz taker has reached the end of the array of questions that are inputted as your score. It uses vanilla javascript, CSS and html(of course).
